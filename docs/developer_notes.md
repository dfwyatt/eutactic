# Developer notes on Eutactic

## Objects
Options:
* Objects exist all the way through the system.
* Or, objects are implemented purely as "syntactic sugar" and the solver core remains unchanged
At present, with the intended scope/capabilities of the object mechanism, the functionality can be implemented as "syntactic sugar" wholly within the parser.
